# Taskify
The repository contains a simple, file-based task management and note-taking application. Built with Node.js and Express.js, it allows users to create, read, and rename text notes directly on the server's file system. It's a great example of a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that uses the local file system as its database.
